This project involves four key tasks:

Polynomial Regression and Non-Parametric Prediction:

Generated training and testing datasets using a sine function with added noise.
Applied polynomial basis functions to transform the data and trained a linear regression model.
Conducted non-parametric prediction using a Gram matrix approach and compared the results with the parametric method.
Reported and analyzed the mean squared error (MSE) for both methods.
Gaussian Process Regression and Bayesian Optimization:

Implemented Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) using an RBF kernel to model the training data.
Applied Bayesian Optimization to iteratively select the most informative samples based on an acquisition function.
Compared the efficiency of Bayesian Optimization against random sampling.
Visualized the cumulative epsilon-optimal sample curve to demonstrate the effectiveness of Bayesian Optimization.
RBF Kernel and Invertibility Check:

Defined the Gram matrix using the RBF kernel.
Checked the invertibility of the covariance matrix and used it to model the data.
Predicted the mean and standard deviation for candidate samples and selected the next sample using an acquisition function.
Compared Bayesian Optimization results with random sampling.
Enhanced Bayesian Optimization:

Loaded and processed the provided data (BO_x.npy and BO_y.npy).
Randomly selected initial training samples and used the rest as candidate samples.
Trained the Gaussian Process model iteratively and selected samples using an acquisition function.
Compared the performance of Bayesian Optimization with random sampling over multiple iterations.
Visualized the optimization results and cumulative epsilon-optimal sample curve.
